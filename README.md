Project based on a store selling guitars. 
We have done the migration of the previous project made with JS adapting it to Typescript: https://github.com/lauraherrero/redux_guitarshop



## Technology Stack 💻
The application has been made from scratch with React using Vite and a store has been used to manage different states of the application. Also react redux has been used to help the handling of reducers and actions.
